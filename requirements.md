## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Data Availability Delays
**Risk:** Economic indicators may not be available at forecast time due to reporting lags.  
**Impact:** High - Reduces model accuracy if key features are unavailable.  
**Mitigation:** Engineer lag features that respect realistic data availability; document and test forecasting scenarios.

### Risk 2: Structural Economic Changes
**Risk:** Economic shocks (recessions, pandemics) may invalidate historical patterns.  
**Impact:** High - Model predictions become unreliable.  
**Mitigation:** Implement model monitoring; consider regime-switching models in future phases; regular retraining.

### Risk 3: Overfitting on Historical Data
**Risk:** Model may capture noise rather than signal, especially with many lag features.  
**Impact:** Medium - Poor generalization to future data.  
**Mitigation:** Use time series cross-validation; apply regularization; feature selection based on domain knowledge.

### Risk 4: Multicollinearity
**Risk:** High correlation between lag features and between economic indicators.  
**Impact:** Medium - Model interpretability issues; unstable coefficients.  
**Mitigation:** Use tree-based models (less sensitive); apply PCA or feature selection; monitor VIF.
